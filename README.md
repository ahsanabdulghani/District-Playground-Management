# District Playground Management

  Languages Used:(Swift-SQL-C#)

• Successfully developed the District Playground Management System as an iOS mobile
  application for my final year project.
  
• The application aims to deliver a wide range of benefits to both users and
  administrators.
  
• Implemented an administration module that allows administrators to add and manage
  grounds, including relevant information such as size, pictures, available facilities,
  location, and cost (with weekend variations).
  
• Created a user-friendly mobile application that displays available time slots for easy
  access and booking.
  
• Implemented a feedback system that allows users to rank and leave comments,
  facilitating continuous improvement and user satisfaction.
